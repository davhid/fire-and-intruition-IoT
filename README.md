# IoT Fire and Intrusion Detection System
An IoT-based fire and intrusion detection system using ESP8266 and Blynk platform.

## Features
- Real-time fire detection using flame sensor
- Smoke/Gas level monitoring
- Mobile notifications via Blynk app
- Email alerts for emergency situations
- LED and buzzer indicators for local warnings
- Relay control for automated response

## Hardware Requirements
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Flame Sensor (Connected to D6)
- Smoke/Gas Sensor (Connected to A0)
- LED (Connected to D7)
- Buzzer (Connected to D2)
- Relay Module (Connected to D1)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Blynk IoT Platform
- Required Libraries:
  - ESP8266WiFi
  - BlynkSimpleEsp8266

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Arduino IDE and required libraries
2. Create a Blynk account and new project
3. Configure WiFi credentials in the code
4. Upload the code to NodeMCU
5. Connect the hardware components according to the pin configuration

## Pin Configuration
```
NodeMCU ESP8266 Connections:
- D7 (GPIO13) -> LED
- D6 (GPIO12) -> Flame Sensor
- D2 (GPIO4)  -> Buzzer
- D1 (GPIO5)  -> Relay
- A0         -> Smoke/Gas Sensor
```
